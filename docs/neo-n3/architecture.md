- **Service Lookup**: Allows services to find other services
- **Health Checking**: Monitors the health of services
- **Load Balancing**: Distributes requests across multiple instances of a service

### Scheduler

The Scheduler is responsible for distributing function execution tasks to worker nodes. It determines which worker node should execute a function based on factors such as load, locality, and resource requirements.

Key components of the Scheduler:
- **Task Queue**: Stores tasks waiting to be executed
- **Worker Registry**: Keeps track of available worker nodes
- **Load Balancer**: Distributes tasks across worker nodes
- **Resource Manager**: Manages resources across worker nodes

### Worker Nodes

Worker Nodes are responsible for executing functions. They provide the runtime environment for functions and manage their lifecycle.

Key components of Worker Nodes:
- **Function Executor**: Executes functions
- **Resource Manager**: Manages resources for function execution
- **Lifecycle Manager**: Manages the lifecycle of functions
- **Monitoring Agent**: Monitors function execution

### JavaScript Runtime

The JavaScript Runtime provides the execution environment for JavaScript functions. It is based on the Deno Core (V8) engine and provides a sandboxed environment with controlled access to resources.

Key components of the JavaScript Runtime:
- **Deno Core (V8)**: JavaScript engine
- **Sandbox**: Provides isolation for function execution
- **Resource Manager**: Controls access to resources
- **Neo N3 API**: Provides access to Neo N3 blockchain
- **Oracle API**: Provides access to oracle services
- **TEE API**: Provides access to TEE services

### Oracle Services

Oracle Services provide access to external data sources such as price feeds, random number generation, and other real-world data. They ensure that the data is reliable and tamper-proof.

Key components of Oracle Services:
- **Data Providers**: Connect to external data sources
- **Data Validators**: Validate data from external sources
- **Data Aggregators**: Aggregate data from multiple sources
- **Data Cache**: Cache data for efficient access

### TEE Services

Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Services provide a secure execution environment for sensitive code and data. They ensure that the code and data are protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

Key components of TEE Services:
- **Enclave Manager**: Manages secure enclaves
- **Attestation Service**: Verifies the integrity of enclaves
- **Key Management**: Manages cryptographic keys
- **Secure Storage**: Provides secure storage for sensitive data

### API Service

The API Service provides REST and GraphQL APIs for platform management. It allows developers to register, deploy, and manage their functions and services.

Key components of the API Service:
- **REST API**: Provides RESTful endpoints
- **GraphQL API**: Provides GraphQL endpoint
- **Authentication**: Authenticates users
- **Authorization**: Controls access to resources
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits API requests
- **Documentation**: Provides API documentation

## Data Flow

### Function Registration and Deployment

1. A developer creates a function and registers it with the platform through the API Service.
2. The API Service validates the function and sends it to the Registry Service.
3. The Registry Service stores the function metadata and code.
4. The Scheduler deploys the function to Worker Nodes based on the deployment strategy.

### Event-Triggered Function Execution

1. The Event System detects an event from the Neo N3 blockchain or other sources.
2. The Event System determines which functions should be triggered based on the event.
3. The Event System sends execution tasks to the Scheduler.
4. The Scheduler distributes the tasks to Worker Nodes.
5. Worker Nodes execute the functions in the JavaScript Runtime.
6. The results are sent back to the Scheduler and then to the Event System.
7. The Event System processes the results and may trigger additional functions.

### API-Triggered Function Execution

1. A client sends a request to the API Service to invoke a function.
2. The API Service validates the request and sends it to the Scheduler.
3. The Scheduler distributes the task to a Worker Node.
4. The Worker Node executes the function in the JavaScript Runtime.
5. The results are sent back to the Scheduler and then to the API Service.
6. The API Service returns the results to the client.

### Oracle Data Access

1. A function requests data from an Oracle Service through the JavaScript Runtime.
2. The Oracle Service retrieves the data from external sources.
3. The Oracle Service validates and aggregates the data.
4. The Oracle Service returns the data to the function.

### TEE Secure Execution

1. A function requests secure execution in a TEE through the JavaScript Runtime.
2. The TEE Service creates a secure enclave for the function.
3. The function is executed in the secure enclave.
4. The results are securely returned to the function.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication and Authorization

The platform uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for authentication and role-based access control for authorization. Users must authenticate with the platform to obtain a JWT token, which is then used for subsequent API requests.

### Function Isolation

Functions are executed in isolated sandboxes to prevent interference between functions and to limit access to resources. The JavaScript Runtime provides a secure execution environment with controlled access to resources.

### Data Protection

Sensitive data is protected using encryption and secure storage. The TEE Services provide a secure execution environment for processing sensitive data, ensuring that the data is protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

### Network Security

All communication between components is encrypted using TLS (Transport Layer Security). The platform also implements network segmentation to limit the attack surface.

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

The platform is designed to scale horizontally by adding more Worker Nodes. The Scheduler distributes tasks across Worker Nodes based on load and resource requirements.

### Event Processing

The Event System uses a distributed event processing architecture to handle high volumes of events. Events are processed in parallel across multiple Event Processors.

### Database Sharding

The Registry Service and Service Discovery use database sharding to distribute data across multiple database instances, allowing the platform to handle large numbers of services and functions.

## Fault Tolerance

### Component Redundancy

Critical components such as the Scheduler and Registry Service are deployed with redundancy to ensure high availability. If one instance fails, another instance takes over.

### Task Retry

If a function execution fails, the Scheduler retries the task on another Worker Node. The platform implements an exponential backoff strategy for retries to prevent overloading the system.

### Circuit Breaking

The platform implements circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures. If a component is experiencing high error rates, the circuit breaker opens and prevents further requests to that component until it recovers.

## Monitoring and Logging

### Metrics Collection

The platform collects metrics from all components to monitor performance and resource usage. Metrics are stored in a time-series database and can be visualized using a dashboard.

### Distributed Tracing

The platform implements distributed tracing to track requests across components. This allows developers to identify performance bottlenecks and troubleshoot issues.

### Centralized Logging

Logs from all components are collected and stored in a centralized logging system. Developers can search and analyze logs to troubleshoot issues.

## Conclusion

The Neo N3 FaaS platform architecture is designed to provide a scalable, secure, and reliable serverless computing environment for Neo N3 blockchain applications. The modular architecture allows for flexibility and extensibility, enabling the platform to adapt to changing requirements and technologies.
