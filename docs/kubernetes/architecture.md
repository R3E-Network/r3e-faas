## System Overview

The R3E FaaS platform is a serverless computing solution designed specifically for blockchain applications. It enables developers to deploy and execute JavaScript functions in a secure, scalable environment with built-in support for Neo N3 and Ethereum blockchains.

### Key Features

- Serverless JavaScript execution
- Blockchain integration (Neo N3, Ethereum)
- Event-driven architecture
- Secure sandboxing
- Built-in services (Oracle, Gas Bank, etc.)
- Cryptographic services (TEE, ZK, FHE)
- Secret management
- Custom triggers and event processing

## Component Architecture

The R3E FaaS platform consists of the following core components:

### API Service

- Handles HTTP requests
- Manages function deployments
- Processes API calls
- Authenticates and authorizes users
- Routes requests to appropriate services

### Worker Service

- Executes JavaScript functions
- Manages function sandboxes
- Handles function scaling
- Processes events and triggers
- Interacts with blockchain networks

### Event System

- Captures events from various sources
- Processes and filters events
- Triggers function execution
- Manages event subscriptions
- Handles event persistence

### Storage System

- Stores function code and metadata
- Manages function state
- Handles persistent data storage
- Provides RocksDB integration
- Manages secret storage

### Built-in Services

- Oracle Service: Provides off-chain data
- Gas Bank: Manages gas for transactions
- Meta Transaction Service: Handles gasless transactions
- Balance Management: Tracks user balances
- Identity Verification: Manages user authentication

### Cryptographic Services

- TEE Service: Secure computing environments
- ZK Service: Zero-knowledge computations
- FHE Service: Fully homomorphic encryption

## Data Flow

### Function Deployment Flow

1. User submits function code via API
2. API service validates and processes the function
3. Function metadata is stored in the database
4. Function code is stored in the storage system
5. Function is ready for execution

### Function Execution Flow

1. Event is captured from a source (blockchain, time, etc.)
2. Event is processed and matched against triggers
3. Matching triggers initiate function execution
4. Worker service creates a sandbox for the function
5. Function is executed with appropriate context
6. Results are processed and stored
7. Any resulting actions (transactions, etc.) are performed

### Event Processing Flow

1. Event sources generate events
2. Events are captured by the event system
3. Events are filtered and processed
4. Matching events trigger function execution
5. Event data is passed to functions
6. Event results are stored for auditing

## Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes Deployment

The R3E FaaS platform is designed for deployment on Kubernetes, with the following components:

#### Core Components

- **API Deployment**: Handles API requests
- **Worker Deployment**: Executes functions
- **Database StatefulSet**: Stores platform data

- **Storage PersistentVolumes**: Stores function data

#### Services

- **API Service**: Exposes API endpoints
- **Database Service**: Internal access to database
- **Redis Service**: Internal access to Redis
- **Worker Service**: Internal service for workers

#### Configuration

- **ConfigMaps**: Store non-sensitive configuration
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive information
- **ServiceAccounts**: Manage permissions
