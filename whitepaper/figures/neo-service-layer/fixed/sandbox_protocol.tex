\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Sandbox Protocol}
\label{alg:sandbox}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Smart contract code, Execution parameters, Security rules
\Ensure Safe contract execution, Resource limitations enforced

\State \textbf{Initialize} Sandbox environment
\State Validate contract code and parameters
\If{contract validation fails}
    \State \Return Error: Invalid contract or parameters
\EndIf

\State Analyze contract for security vulnerabilities
\If{critical vulnerabilities detected}
    \State Log security warnings
    \State \Return Error: Security validation failed
\EndIf

\State Set up isolated virtual machine
\State Configure resource limitations (memory, CPU, network)
\State Prepare monitoring system

\State Load contract into virtual machine
\State Apply security rules and access controls
\State \textbf{Begin} execution monitoring

\While{contract is executing}
    \State Monitor resource usage and execution flow
    \If{resource limit exceeded}
        \State Terminate execution
        \State \Return Error: Resource limit exceeded
    \EndIf
    \If{security rule violated}
        \State Terminate execution
        \State Log security violation
        \State \Return Error: Security rule violated
    \EndIf
\EndWhile

\State Verify execution result integrity
\State Log execution statistics
\State Clean up sandbox environment

\State \Return Success with execution results
