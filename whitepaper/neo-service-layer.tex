\subsection{Core Services}
\label{subsec:nsl-core-services}

The Neo Service Layer provides several core services that enhance the capabilities of Neo Smart Contracts and improve the user experience. These services address common challenges in blockchain application development and enable new use cases that would be difficult or impossible to implement using on-chain logic alone.

\subsubsection{Gas Bank}
\label{subsubsec:gas-bank}

The Gas Bank service provides a solution to one of the most significant barriers to blockchain adoption: the requirement for users to hold native tokens (GAS) to pay for transaction fees. This requirement creates friction for new users and limits the adoption of decentralized applications.

\input{figures/neo-service-layer/gas_bank}

The Gas Bank allows application developers to create accounts that can pay for transaction fees on behalf of their users, enabling a seamless user experience similar to traditional web applications. Users can interact with decentralized applications without needing to acquire GAS tokens first, removing a significant barrier to entry.

\begin{definition}[Gas Bank Account]
A Gas Bank Account is a managed account that holds GAS tokens and can be used to pay for transaction fees on behalf of users. Each account has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Address: The unique identifier of the account
    \item Balance: The amount of GAS tokens available for fee payment
    \item Fee Model: The fee calculation model (fixed, percentage, dynamic, or free)
    \item Credit Limit: The maximum amount of credit that can be extended to the account
    \item Used Credit: The amount of credit currently used
    \item Status: The current status of the account (active, suspended, etc.)
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The Gas Bank supports multiple fee models to accommodate different application requirements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Fixed Fee}: A constant fee regardless of the transaction size or complexity
    \item \textbf{Percentage Fee}: A fee calculated as a percentage of the transaction amount
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Fee}: A fee that varies based on network conditions and transaction complexity
    \item \textbf{Free}: No fee charged to the user (all costs absorbed by the application)
\end{itemize}

The Gas Bank service also provides credit facilities, allowing applications to continue operating even when their Gas Bank account balance is temporarily depleted. This feature ensures uninterrupted service for users while giving application developers time to replenish their accounts.

\subsubsection{Meta Transaction Service}
\label{subsubsec:meta-tx}

Meta transactions enable users to interact with smart contracts without directly paying for transaction fees, further reducing the barriers to blockchain adoption. The Meta Transaction Service acts as a relay that receives signed transaction requests from users, verifies their validity, and submits them to the blockchain on behalf of the users.

\input{figures/neo-service-layer/meta_tx}

\begin{definition}[Meta Transaction]
A Meta Transaction is a transaction request that is signed by a user but submitted to the blockchain by a relayer. The relayer pays for the transaction fees, while the transaction itself is executed as if it were submitted by the original user.
\end{definition}

The Meta Transaction Service supports multiple blockchain types and signature curves, enabling interoperability between Neo N3 and other blockchain ecosystems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Neo N3 with secp256r1}: Standard Neo N3 transactions and signatures
    \item \textbf{Ethereum with secp256k1}: Ethereum-compatible transactions and signatures, including EIP-712 typed data signing
\end{itemize}

This cross-chain compatibility is particularly valuable for applications that operate across multiple blockchain ecosystems, as it allows users to interact with contracts on different chains using a single signature mechanism.

The Meta Transaction Service integrates with the Gas Bank to pay for transaction fees, creating a comprehensive solution for fee abstraction. Application developers can configure the service to use specific Gas Bank accounts for different contracts or transaction types, enabling fine-grained control over fee allocation.

\subsubsection{Oracle Service}
\label{subsubsec:oracle}

Blockchain smart contracts operate in a deterministic environment isolated from external data sources. This isolation ensures security and predictability but limits the types of applications that can be built using smart contracts alone. The Oracle Service bridges this gap by providing a secure and reliable way for smart contracts to access external data.

\input{figures/neo-service-layer/oracle}

    \item \textbf{Confidential Smart Contracts}: Execution of contracts with private state and logic
    \item \textbf{Secure Key Management}: Protection of cryptographic keys and credentials
\end{itemize}

The TEE service provides attestation reports that verify the integrity and authenticity of the execution environment. These reports can be verified on-chain, allowing smart contracts to trust the results of off-chain computations.

\subsubsection{Abstract Account Service}
\label{subsubsec:abstract-account}

The Abstract Account service provides advanced account management capabilities beyond what is possible with standard blockchain accounts. This service enables features such as multi-signature control, account recovery, and programmable authorization policies.

\input{figures/neo-service-layer/abstract_account}

\begin{definition}[Abstract Account]
An Abstract Account is a smart contract-based account that implements advanced control and authorization mechanisms. Each abstract account has:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Address: A unique identifier for the account
    \item Owner: The primary controller of the account
    \item Controllers: Additional entities that can authorize operations
    \item Policy: Rules governing how operations are authorized
    \item Contract: The underlying smart contract implementing the account logic
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

The Abstract Account service supports various account operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Adding/Removing Controllers}: Modifying the set of entities that can control the account
    \item \textbf{Updating Policies}: Changing the rules for operation authorization
    \item \textbf{Account Recovery}: Recovering access to an account after key loss
    \item \textbf{Custom Operations}: Application-specific operations defined by the account contract
\end{itemize}

This service is particularly valuable for applications requiring enhanced security, corporate governance, or complex authorization workflows. By abstracting account management into a dedicated service, applications can implement sophisticated control mechanisms without burdening users with technical complexity.
