# Neo N3 Confidential Computing Example

This example demonstrates how to implement confidential computing using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) in the Neo N3 FaaS platform. Confidential computing protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested secure environment.

## Overview

The confidential computing example shows how to:

1. Process sensitive data within a TEE without exposing it to the host system
2. Perform secure computation on encrypted data
3. Implement privacy-preserving analytics
4. Ensure data integrity and confidentiality during computation
5. Integrate confidential computing with Neo N3 blockchain applications

## Files

- `function.js`: The JavaScript function that implements the confidential computing service
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for the confidential computing service
- `register.js`: Script to register the function with the FaaS platform
- `smart-contract/`: Directory containing a sample Neo N3 smart contract that interacts with the confidential computing service
- `lib/`: Directory containing confidential computing libraries and utilities

## Prerequisites

- Neo N3 FaaS platform installed and running
- Access to a Neo N3 node (testnet or mainnet)
- Node.js installed for running the registration script
- Neo N3 smart contract development environment (optional, for testing the smart contract)
- TEE-enabled hardware (Intel SGX, AMD SEV, or ARM TrustZone)

## Setup

1. Configure your Neo N3 node connection and TEE settings in `config.yaml`
2. Register the function using the registration script:

```bash
node register.js
```

3. (Optional) Deploy the sample smart contract to interact with the confidential computing service

## How It Works

The confidential computing service leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect data during computation. The TEE provides hardware-based isolation that ensures sensitive data is never exposed in plaintext outside the secure environment.

### Secure Data Processing

Data is encrypted before being sent to the TEE, and only decrypted inside the secure environment:

```javascript
// Example secure data processing within TEE
async function processDataSecurely(encryptedData, encryptionKey) {
  // Verify the TEE environment through attestation
  await tee.attestation.verify();
  
  // Decrypt the data inside the TEE
  const data = await tee.crypto.decrypt(encryptedData, encryptionKey);
  
  // Process the data securely within the TEE
  const result = await performSensitiveComputation(data);
  
  // Encrypt the result before returning it
  const encryptedResult = await tee.crypto.encrypt(result, encryptionKey);
  
  return encryptedResult;
}
```

### Privacy-Preserving Analytics

The example demonstrates how to perform analytics on sensitive data without exposing individual records:

```javascript
// Example privacy-preserving analytics
async function computeAggregateStatistics(encryptedRecords) {
  // Decrypt and process records within the TEE
  const records = await decryptRecordsInTEE(encryptedRecords);
  
  // Compute aggregate statistics
  const statistics = {
    count: records.length,
    sum: records.reduce((sum, record) => sum + record.value, 0),
    average: records.reduce((sum, record) => sum + record.value, 0) / records.length,
    min: Math.min(...records.map(record => record.value)),
    max: Math.max(...records.map(record => record.value))
  };
  
  // Apply differential privacy to add noise to the results
  const privatizedStatistics = applyDifferentialPrivacy(statistics);
  
  return privatizedStatistics;
}
```

### Secure Multi-Party Computation

The example includes secure multi-party computation where multiple parties can jointly compute a result without revealing their inputs:

```javascript
// Example secure multi-party computation
async function secureMultiPartyComputation(encryptedInputs, parties) {
  // Verify all parties through remote attestation
  await verifyAllParties(parties);
  
  // Establish secure channels with all parties
  const secureChannels = await establishSecureChannels(parties);
  
  // Receive encrypted inputs from all parties
  const allInputs = await receiveEncryptedInputs(secureChannels);
  
  // Perform joint computation within the TEE
  const result = await performJointComputation(allInputs);
  
  // Encrypt the result for each party
  const encryptedResults = await encryptResultsForParties(result, parties);
  
  return encryptedResults;
}
```

### Blockchain Integration

The example demonstrates integration with Neo N3 blockchain for verifiable confidential computing:

```javascript
// Example blockchain integration
async function verifiableConfidentialComputation(input, proof) {
  // Verify the computation proof on the blockchain
  const isValid = await verifyProofOnChain(proof);
  
  if (!isValid) {
    throw new Error('Invalid computation proof');
  }
  
  // Perform the confidential computation
  const result = await performConfidentialComputation(input);
  
  // Generate a proof of the computation
  const computationProof = await generateComputationProof(result);
  
  // Record the proof on the blockchain
  await recordProofOnChain(computationProof);
  
  return { result, proof: computationProof };
}
```

## Security Considerations

When using this example, be aware of the following security considerations:

1. **TEE Limitations**: While TEEs provide strong security guarantees, they are not immune to all attacks. Stay updated on the latest security advisories for your TEE technology.

2. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Be aware that some sophisticated side-channel attacks might still be possible against TEEs.

3. **Data Minimization**: Only process the minimum amount of sensitive data required for your application.

4. **Attestation**: Always verify the TEE environment through remote attestation before sending sensitive data.

5. **Encryption**: Use strong encryption for data in transit to and from the TEE.

## Customization

You can customize this example by:

- Implementing additional confidential computing algorithms
- Integrating with different TEE technologies
- Adding support for specific privacy-preserving use cases
- Extending the blockchain integration for your specific requirements
- Implementing domain-specific confidential computing services
