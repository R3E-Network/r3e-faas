# Neo N3 Custom Oracle Service Example

This example demonstrates how to create custom oracle services for the Neo N3 FaaS platform. Custom oracle services allow you to extend the platform's oracle capabilities with your own specialized data sources and processing logic.

## Overview

The custom oracle service example shows how to:

1. Create a custom oracle service that fetches data from specialized sources
2. Implement custom data processing and transformation logic
3. Integrate the custom oracle with Neo N3 smart contracts
4. Secure the oracle service with authentication and rate limiting
5. Deploy and manage the custom oracle service

## Files

- `function.js`: The JavaScript function that implements the custom oracle service
- `config.yaml`: Configuration file for the custom oracle service
- `register.js`: Script to register the function with the FaaS platform
- `smart-contract/`: Directory containing a sample Neo N3 smart contract that uses the custom oracle
- `lib/`: Directory containing custom oracle service libraries and utilities

## Prerequisites

- Neo N3 FaaS platform installed and running
- Access to a Neo N3 node (testnet or mainnet)
- Node.js installed for running the registration script
- Neo N3 smart contract development environment (optional, for testing the smart contract)

## Setup

1. Configure your Neo N3 node connection and custom oracle settings in `config.yaml`
2. Register the function using the registration script:

```bash
node register.js
```

3. (Optional) Deploy the sample smart contract to interact with the custom oracle service

## How It Works

The custom oracle service function fetches data from specialized sources, processes it according to custom logic, and provides it to Neo N3 smart contracts. The function can be triggered on a schedule or on-demand when a smart contract requests data.

### Custom Data Sources

The example demonstrates fetching data from several specialized sources:

- Weather data from meteorological APIs
- Sports results from sports data providers
- Social media sentiment from social media APIs
- IoT device data from IoT platforms
- Custom API endpoints

### Custom Processing Logic

The example implements several custom processing techniques:

- Data aggregation and filtering
- Format conversion and normalization
- Custom validation rules
- Data enrichment with additional context
- Complex transformations and calculations

### Integration with Neo N3

The example shows how to:

- Receive requests from Neo N3 smart contracts
- Process the requests based on custom parameters
- Return the results in a format usable by smart contracts
- Handle errors and edge cases

## Customization

You can customize this example by:

- Adding your own specialized data sources
- Implementing your own data processing logic
- Modifying the authentication and security mechanisms
- Extending the smart contract integration
